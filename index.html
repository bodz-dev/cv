        <p><em>My name is <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.co.uk/">Bodrul</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>I always had an interest in computers from a very young age, at home when there was an issue with the
          computer my family would call me to fix the problem all the time.<br>
          I started college and went to University in a different field later on realizing that it was not for me and
          ended up dropping out. I got a couple of jobs along the way and have always felt something was missing in my
          life till a colleague one day at work, introduced me to the programming side of computers. It has been an
          immense change in my life immediately. I fell in love with programming I am currently pursuing a career to
          become a Front End Developer hopefully one day I can achieve this.</p>
